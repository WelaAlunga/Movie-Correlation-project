# Movie-Correlation-project

This project looked to answer the question "what is closely correlated to the gross income a movie makes"? The data used is from Kaggle and it shows movies over the last decade. The hypothesis was that the budget of the movie would closely affect how much the movie would make in gross income. Used the pearson correlation coefficient to prove not only does the budget affect gross income the most but if a movie got voted highly then it was more likely to have a higher gross income.
